# Food Vision :hamburger: :camera:



As an introductory project to myself, I built an end-to-end **CNN Image Classification Model** which identifies the food in your image. 

I worked out with a pre-trained Image Classification Model that comes with Keras and then retrained it on the infamous **Food101** Dataset.

### Fun Fact 

The Model actually beats the [**DeepFood**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05675.pdf) Paper's model which also trained on the same dataset.

The Accuracy aquired by DeepFood was **77.4%** and our model's **85%** . Difference of **8%** ain't much, but the interesting thing is, DeepFood's model took **2-3 days** to train while our's barely took **90min**.
